## Description
Test Xcode Project for building a universal framework

### Overview
It is evolutionary, not revolutionary, for most iOS developers to go from copying the same set of "library" files from project to project, to creating a static library which is then shared between projects to finally creating a universal framework.  From my humble point of view the universal framework is the ideal solution because it gives you the ability to just hand off a single framework (which is really a directory), which keeps code implementation hidden, and still have access to a static library that can be edited and shared within a shared workspace.
